					<P> Once upon a time, there was a little boy who dreamt of studying abroad. He grew up in a small home, at the edge of the city of Hyderabad, India. While both his parents worked hard everyday to put food on the table for 5, he worked as hard to be at the top of his school. He topped the 12th grade in mathematics and physics, and then went on to pursue higher studies. </P>
